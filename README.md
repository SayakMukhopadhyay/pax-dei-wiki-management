# Pax Dei wiki progress notes
Writing for the wiki can be a bit challenging, mostly because the current wiki doesn't come with most templates that are present in wikipedia. I could try to add those templates but there is a chance that something might go wrong and I am not willing to take the risk now. So, I will note down everything I am doing and what workarounds I am making in order to get around the challenges so that once we move to wiki.gg, we can start from scratch with a fresh setup.

I will also add files that I intend to backup.
