# Pax Dei wiki progress notes
Writing for the wiki can be a bit challenging, mostly because the current wiki doesn't come with most templates that are present in wikipedia. I could try to add those templates but there is a chance that something might go wrong and I am not willing to take the risk now. So, I will note down everything I am doing and what workarounds I am making in order to get around the challenges so that once we move to wiki.gg, we can start from scratch with a fresh setup.

I will also add files that I intend to backup.

## Pax_Dei
I am copying over from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Dei_(video_game) and removing all templates as we don't have any templates created. The idea is to keep these 2 articles in sync. Once we move to gg, we will create the requisite templates and then copy over from wikipedia once again, making sure to keep the link alterations done in the mediawiki site.

A major thing that gets altered is how references are handled. I have to remove the cite template from `<ref>` links and use `<references />` instead of the `{{reflist}}` template. These need to be brought back. Its relatively easy to bring back the references as we can copy over from Wikipedia and hence not backing it up.
